# Data Processing

This directory contains code for preparing and analyzing data for the ambulance simulator.

## Files

- **princeton_data_prep.py**: Utilities for preparing Princeton geographical data, including sparsifying graphs and generating synthetic call data.
- **analyze_princeton_graph.py**: Tools for analyzing the Princeton graph, including statistics and visualizations.

## Usage

These files are primarily used for data preparation before running simulations. They handle tasks such as:

1. Converting raw geographical data into usable formats
2. Generating synthetic call data based on real-world patterns
3. Analyzing graph properties for optimization purposes
4. Creating and manipulating distance and travel time matrices
